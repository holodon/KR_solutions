### My solutions to all exercises from the book "The C Programming Language" Second Edition by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie


- Single file solutions, compile- and test-ready;
- Balanced towards simplicity, without sacrificing too much flexibility;
- All solutions are based only on the already learned stuff in the current/previous chapters;
- Every file can compile and run with no special dependencies (except some standard library headers);
- Contributions/bug fixes/better solutions are of course welcome.
