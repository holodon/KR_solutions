Equifax
is
in
trouble
The
credit
reporting
company
failed
to
protect
the
personal
financial
data
of
as
many
as
143
million
Americans
Equifaxs
failure
exposed
not
just
names
and
addresses
but
also
Social
Security
numbers
birth
dates
drivers
license
numbers
and
credit
card
numbers
The
Federal
Trade
Commission
Congress
and
about
40
state
attorneys
general
are
investigating
the
data
breach
and
both
the
Massachusetts
attorney
general
and
the
city
of
San
Francisco
are
suing
on
behalf
of
residents
whose
information
was
compromised

reform
and

accountability

Thats
a
start
But
its
not
enough
Equifaxs
failure
calls
for
the
corporate
death
penalty
through
a
rare
but
vital
procedure
called
judicial
dissolution

Under
the
law
of
Georgia
where
Equifax
is
incorporated
the
state
attorney
general
may
file
a
lawsuit
in
state
court
to
dissolve
a
corporation
if
the
corporation
has
continued
to
exceed
or
abuse
the
authority
conferred
upon
it
by
law
(All
50
states
have
similar
provisions)
State
attorneys
general
dont
invoke
these
corporate
death
penalty
statutes
often
especially
not
against
large
well-known
corporations
But
Equifax
could
not
have
obtained
its
unusually
important
position
in
our
economy
without
the
privileges
of
a
corporate
charter
conferred
by
law
and
it
has
forfeited
its
claim
to
those
privileges

Equifaxs
entire
reason
for
existence
is
to
collect
and
maintain
private
financial
data
about
individuals
who
are
not
customers
of
the
company
This
isnt
like
other
data
breaches
such
as
the
2012
credit
card
data
breach
at
Barnes
&
Noble
or
the
2015
hack
of
frequent-flyer
account
data
at
British
Airways
Those
breaches
were
bad
But
they
affected
people
who
had
chosen
to
do
business
with
these
companies
by
buying
books
or
airplane
trips
Most
of
the
people
whose
data
was
compromised
by
Equifaxs
lax
security
dont
even
know
that
Equifax
exists
let
alone
that
it
maintains
their
private
financial
data

While
theres
never
an
excuse
for
major
companies
to
be
sloppy
with
customer
data
Barnes
&
Noble
and
British
Airways
arent
in
the
business
of
securely
storing
private
financial
data
Theyre
in
the
businesses
of
selling
books
and
flying
airplanes
When
a
bookstore
or
airline
doesnt
manage
customer
data
well
then
the
company
needs
to
compensate
its
customers
for
its
negligence
accept
its
punishment
and
reform
But
when
a
companys
entire
reason
for
being
is
managing
individuals
most
sensitive
private
financial
data
and
it
fails
spectacularly
it
should
not
be
further
entrusted
with
that
important
responsibility

Equifaxs
conduct
after
the
breach
has
given
little
comfort
Before
revealing
the
breach
to
the
public
senior
executives
sold
$2
million
worth
of
stock
Meanwhile
after
the
breach
was
made
public
Equifax
offered
consumers
free
credit
monitoring—but
tried
to
force
them
to
accept
a
mandatory
arbitration
provision
clause
buried
in
the
fine
print

In
fact
Equifax
wasnt
even
competent
enough
to
close
the
stable
door
after
the
horse
had
bolted
Over
a
week
after
the
US
breach
was
revealed
a
small
computer
company
in
Milwaukee
noticed
that
in
one
Equifax
computer
system
based
in
South
America
customer
records
could
still
be
accessed
by
entering
the
username
admin
and
the
passwordadmin

This
is
not
the
conduct
of
a
company
that
deserves
to
continue
to
be
entrusted
with
a
critical
role
in
our
economy
State
laws
enable
the
creation
of
corporations
because
they
are
thought
to
confer
a
benefit
on
society
But
not
in
this
case
Equifax
had
one
job
and
it
failed
More
than
half
of
American
adults
woke
up
one
day
to
learn
that
a
corporation
that
few
had
ever
heard
of
had
lost
control
of
financial
data
that
they
never
knowingly
gave
it

Dissolving
Equifax
would
not
require
putting
innocent
people
out
of
work
or
demolishing
its
office
buildings
Working
with
a
court-appointed
receiver
the
Georgia
attorney
general
could
develop
a
plan
to
deconstruct
Equifaxs
current
corporate
structure
It
could
continue
to
operate
and
pay
its
staff
and
vendors
while
dissolution
is
pending
in
court
and
legitimate
business
lines
could
operate
successfully
afterwards
under
new
ownership

Equifaxs
core
customer
data
business
meanwhile
has
some
assets
that
could
be
sold
to
competitors
or
other
new
owners
Some
of
the
main
so-called
assets
however
are
questionable:
the
private
financial
data
which
the
company
can
no
longer
be
entrusted
to
maintain;
the
computer
code
that
maintains
and
protects
that
data
which
evidently
is
inadequate
to
the
task;
and
the
intangible
value
of
Equifax
as
a
going
concern
known
in
accounting
as
goodwill
Dissolving
the
company
would
certainly
eliminate
any
remaining
goodwill
But
frankly
Equifax
doesnt
have
much
goodwill
these
days
anyway

To
be
fair
Georgias
attorney
general
Chris
Carr
hasnt
ignored
the
Equifax
breach
He
signed
a
group
letter
to
Equifax
along
with
over
30
other
state
attorneys
general
and
joined
the
larger
multi-state
investigation
Yet
Carr
has
been
content
simply
to
participate
in
a
broader
coalition
emphasizing
his
duty
to
protect
Georgias
consumers
Thats
a
start
but
not
the
end
Because
of
his
offices
unique
oversight
powers
over
Georgia
corporations
Carr
needs
to
ask
larger
questions—including
whether
Equifaxs
abuse
of
its
state-granted
corporate
powers
justifies
revoking
its
corporate
charter

A
few
years
ago—starting
soon
after
the
Supreme
Courts
2010
Citizens
United
decision
which
held
that
corporations
have
the
same
right
as
people
to
spend
money
to
influence
elections—a
popular
bumper
sticker
proclaimed
Ill
believe
corporations
are
people
when
Texas
executes
one

We
shouldnt
use
the
corporate
death
penalty
lightly
But
at
this
point
Equifax
has
lost
its
justification
for
existence
